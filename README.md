Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable

My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
Breaking down code into smaller files enhances code organization and readability. By focusing each file on a specific task or component, developers can easily understand and maintain the codebase. This approach promotes code reuse and scalability, as smaller files can be reused across different parts of the application and make it easier to manage as the project grows. Additionally, it facilitates collaboration among team members, allowing them to work on different parts of the codebase concurrently and reducing conflicts.
